I'm excited to share my first Power BI project, an interactive HR analytics dashboard.
I have used complex parameters to drill down into worksheets and customize the dashboard with filters and slicers.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
👉The Main Aim of this dashboard is to provide insights of attritions in the company. Insights through this dashboard can help company to gather all the major KPIs related to employee attrition which can help to have a more employee centric workplace.

🚀 THE JOURNEY:
This journey was filled with five critical phases:

1. Data Extraction
2. Data Transformation
3. Data Loading
4. Data Implementation
5. Report Creation

🔑 KEY INSIGHTS:
Here are some of the key findings from this project:

The age group of 26 to 35 experienced the highest attrition rate.
Individuals with a background in Life Sciences and those in Laboratory Technician roles had the highest attrition percentages.
Employees with 1 to 2 years of experience showed the highest attrition rates.
Job satisfaction was found to be directly proportional to attrition.
Interestingly, employees earning below the average salary of 6.5k were more likely to leave the company.

🌟 PROJECT LEARNING:
This project has been a tremendous learning experience, and it led to several valuable insights:

Identification of critical factors to reduce attrition rates.
Streamlining the hiring process for better outcomes.
Enhancing the overall employee experience.
Boosting workforce productivity.
Gained expertise in creating custom visualizations, including bar charts 📊, pie charts 🥧, donut charts 🍩, scattered charts, and effective use of filters and slicers.
